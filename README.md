# Blockchain-Based Medical Device Lifecycle Management (MedDevChain)

## Overview

MedDevChain is a blockchain-based platform designed to manage the complete lifecycle of medical devices from manufacturing to retirement. By leveraging distributed ledger technology, MedDevChain creates an immutable, transparent record of each medical device's journey through the healthcare ecosystem, ensuring regulatory compliance, patient safety, and operational efficiency.

## Core Components

### 1. Manufacturer Verification Contract
Validates and registers legitimate medical device manufacturers within the system. This smart contract maintains a registry of authorized producers with verified digital identities, manufacturing licenses, and regulatory certifications. Only verified manufacturers can register new devices on the platform.

### 2. Device Registration Contract
Records comprehensive details of medical equipment at the point of production. Each device receives a unique digital identity on the blockchain with tamper-proof records of:
- Manufacturing date and location
- Model and serial numbers
- Component materials and sources
- Regulatory certifications (FDA, CE, etc.)
- Technical specifications
- Intended use categories
- Expected service life

### 3. Installation Verification Contract
Tracks the deployment and installation of medical devices in healthcare facilities. This contract records:
- Installation location and date
- Installing technician credentials
- Pre-deployment quality checks
- Calibration parameters
- Integration with existing systems
- Acceptance testing results
- Healthcare facility verification

### 4. Maintenance Tracking Contract
Manages the complete service history and maintenance requirements throughout the device lifecycle. This contract handles:
- Scheduled maintenance intervals
- Maintenance procedure documentation
- Parts replacement records
- Software/firmware updates
- Calibration history
- Technician certifications
- Compliance with manufacturer specifications
- Service life monitoring

### 5. Incident Reporting Contract
Records malfunctions, adverse events, and safety incidents involving the medical devices. This contract enables:
- Standardized incident documentation
- Severity classification
- Root cause analysis
- Corrective actions taken
- Regulatory reporting integration
- Device recall management
- Patient impact assessment
- Statistical analysis for safety monitoring

## Technical Architecture

MedDevChain is built on a permissioned blockchain infrastructure that provides:

- **Data Integrity**: Tamper-evident records of device history
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Automated documentation for FDA, EU MDR, and other regulatory frameworks
- **Interoperability**: Standard protocols for integration with hospital systems, regulatory databases, and manufacturer ERPs
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for different stakeholders
- **Privacy Protection**: Selective disclosure of sensitive information
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Instant access to device status and history
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle millions of devices and transactions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Enterprise blockchain platform (Hyperledger Fabric or Quorum recommended)
- Private key infrastructure for secure identity management

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/meddevchain.git
cd meddevchain
npm install
```

### Configuration
1. Set up your blockchain network configuration in `network-config.json`
2. Deploy the smart contracts to your blockchain network:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
3. Configure access controls and user roles in `access-control.json`

## Usage Examples

### Registering a New Manufacturer
```javascript
const MedDevChain = require('meddevchain-sdk');
const client = new MedDevChain.Client(config);

await client.registerManufacturer({
  name: "MedTech Innovations, Inc.",
  registrationNumber: "FDA-MFR-123456",
  publicKey: "0x...",
  certifications: [
    {type: "ISO13485", issuer: "TÜV SÜD", expiryDate: "2026-05-15"},
    {type: "FDA Establishment", issuer: "FDA", expiryDate: "2027-03-22"}
  ],
  address: {
    street: "123 Innovation Way",
    city: "Boston",
    state: "MA",
    country: "USA",
    postalCode: "02115"
  }
});
```

### Registering a New Medical Device
```javascript
await client.registerDevice({
  manufacturerId: "0x...",
  deviceType: "Infusion Pump",
  model: "InfuseTech 5000",
  serialNumber: "IF5K-2025-78342",
  udiNumber: "00844588005272",
  riskClass: "Class II",
  regulatoryCertifications: [
    {region: "US", number: "K123456", date: "2024-12-10"},
    {region: "EU", number: "MDR-2024-9876", date: "2025-01-15"}
  ],
  components: [
    {name: "Flow regulator", serialNumber: "FR-334455", supplier: "FluidControl Systems"},
    {name: "Pressure sensor", serialNumber: "PS-998877", supplier: "MedSensors Inc."}
  ],
  softwareVersion: "v3.2.1"
});
```

### Recording Device Maintenance
```javascript
await client.recordMaintenance({
  deviceId: "0x...",
  maintenanceType: "Preventive",
  technician: {
    name: "Alex Rodriguez",
    certificationId: "MDBIOTECH-2345",
    organization: "BioMed Services"
  },
  procedures: [
    "Flow rate calibration",
    "Pressure sensor verification",
    "Battery replacement",
    "Software update to v3.2.2"
  ],
  findings: "Minor wear on pump rotor, within acceptable limits",
  partsReplaced: [
    {part: "Battery pack", serialNumber: "BP-112233", lotNumber: "LOT2025-03-A"}
  ],
  nextMaintenanceDue: "2025-11-06",
  testResults: {
    flowRateAccuracy: "98.7%",
    batteryPerformance: "100%",
    alarmFunctionality: "Pass"
  }
});
```

## Security and Privacy Considerations

- **Identity Management**: Strong digital identity verification for all system participants
- **Data Protection**: Encryption of sensitive patient and proprietary information
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access to different aspects of device data
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all actions taken within the system
- **Compliance**: Built-in controls to meet HIPAA, GDPR, and medical device regulations
- **Key Management**: Secure management of cryptographic keys and access credentials
- **Threat Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for unauthorized access attempts

## Regulatory Compliance

MedDevChain is designed to help organizations comply with:
- FDA UDI (Unique Device Identification) requirements
- EU MDR (Medical Device Regulation)
- ISO 13485 quality management standards
- FDA 21 CFR Part 820 (Quality System Regulation)
- MDSAP (Medical Device Single Audit Program)
